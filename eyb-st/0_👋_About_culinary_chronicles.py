            At the time of this writing, I own more close to 100 cookbooks totaling more than 16K recipes. For the past few years, I‚Äôve been taking note of each recipe 
            I cook from my cookbooks and some online magazines, and I log these assets 
            to <a href="https://www.eatyourbooks.com/">EatYourBooks</a> (EYB).
        </p>
        <p>
            EYB is a website for all avid cookbook collectors. The EYB community has indexed 
            about 12.3K cookbooks (or 2.3 million recipes) for recipe names and ingredients. 
            As a member, I add my cookbooks to my virtual bookshelf.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means I have all recipe names, book titles, and also all ingredients 
            from my cookbooks that have been indexed (which is really most Anglophone books) 
            in a digital format. I use that to bookmark every recipe I cook with the month 
            and year when I cooked it. The assets I enter (my cookbooks and bookmarks) are 
            available for download as <code>.csv</code> files directly from the website.
