193233,2152389,2022-04-01,,I really enjoyed them! We ate them really quickly!
190162,2130886,2022-02-25,2000-03,
190162,2130986,2022-02-21,2000-03,
167203,1533070,2022-02-15,,I found these unexpectedly phenomenally good - the right level of sweetness coming from the cranberries and the fennel seeds added a unique flavour. Perfectly good with savoury and sweet toppings.
182073,1855688,2022-02-01,,"For a two layer cake in a 20xm spring form, I doubled the cake recipe but not the cream and ganache. It was perfect!"
200159,2602353,2021-11-23,,I made the version with beans and they came out somewhat dry and nevertheless tasty
200159,2602133,2021-11-11,,The smell in the kitchen was amazing!
200159,2602358,2021-11-07,,Delicious served with coconut rice.
200159,2601466,2021-11-07,,This was delicious - with dried apricots and cardamom. I used 1 tsp ground cardamom and next time will double it.
200159,2602819,2021-11-04,,This was delicious even though I made it with tinned peaches and frozen blueberries. I didn't see the point of the roasting the fruit so next time I will skip this step to compare.
200159,2602368,2021-10-29,,The flavours were spectacular and overall the whole thing wasn't too hard to put together.
200159,2602150,2021-10-14,,"This was good but too heavy, smaller portions would be better. Next time I'd use skimmed milk and skip the double cream."
200159,2602355,2021-10-02,,I made this without the tahini or yogurt and it was delicious!
200159,2602351,2021-10-02,,I used tinned tomatoes and was delicious!
195052,2473746,2021-09-30,,"I made this and by far is the biggest disappointment in this book. I didn't like it, I thought there was too much chocolate, it was too heavy because of all the nuts - what a shame given the ingredients. It makes way more than necessary for the dish and unfortunately it will go to the bin. I won't be making it again."
195052,2473710,2021-08-08,,"This is very good without the orange,"
187722,2019594,2021-06-30,,"This was an amazing cake - very moist, just what a chocolate cake should be. On top of it, soo easy to make."
198372,2484333,2021-06-15,,This turned out too bitter - maybe because I used pickled beetroot?
198372,2484291,2021-06-05,,I made this but added some coriander which turned something delicious into completely inedible. Will have to make it again.
198372,2484345,2021-05-25,,"This was delicious with the following substitutions: I used almonds instead if pistachios, I also didn’t have enough herbs so added a handful of spinach, and I used salmon fillets. Served with boiled potatoes. Yummy"
198372,2484327,2021-05-16,,This was good but next time I'll reduce the pomegranate molasses.
198372,2484341,2021-05-13,,I used chana masala spice blend and it was great!
182073,1855668,2021-04-17,,"This was very tasty but I found the 25 minutes on 150 fan were not enough for one large cake, it clearly needed longer."
176234,1686299,2021-04-11,,These spread a lot when baking so next time should put them in the fridge before baking and/or leave more space between them.
176234,1685094,2021-04-11,,This was delicious with some extra ketchup in the meat since it was a bit dry.
176234,1686295,2021-04-05,,"The salad was delicious, I didn't have any onions, and didn't miss them :)"
176234,1686303,2021-03-27,,This was soooo delicious!
176234,1685099,2021-03-24,,This was delicious. I didn’t have any Jerusalem artichoke so added some petit pois instead.
179000,1843947,2021-03-17,,"I added some tomatoes, and I used sweet potatoes, and I didn't have any breadcrumbs. Overall, fairly boring."
103182,2199341,2021-03-04,,This has got to be one of my favourite chicken recipes! The chicken cooks in the broth which makes it very tender.
195740,2359690,2021-03-03,,"I made only the coconut dal, without the aubergines."
88843,839142,2021-02-17,,These were delicious but turned out more like shortbread biscuits rather than cakes. I cut them in love hearts.
191469,2208293,2021-02-12,,I substituted arugula with red bell pepper and it was delicious. Baking took about 15 min. Very tasty.
15348,377474,2021-02-07,,This makes a huge quantity! I baked them without the crumble - they were tasty but nothing special.
15348,377470,2021-02-07,,Used mixture of wholemeal flour and plain. Good but nothing special; wasn't too keen on the baked raspberries.
15348,377471,2021-02-07,,"Very tasty; used 250 g butter but seemed too much next time - less. The glaze only adds sweetness, better without."
15348,377456,2021-02-07,,The vinegar I used was too overpowering. Wouldn't make it again.
15348,377417,2021-02-07,,"I skipped the sage, chillies and cream - it was OK but boring."
140796,1335511,2021-02-03,,"This was ok, but nothing spectacular. The cauliflower was a bit bland, roasting it might have worked better."
193483,2277538,2021-01-24,,"This is an amazing fish, so much more than the sum of its parts. I never got used to tahini in savoury dishes and a generous squeeze of lemon juice was just perfect!"
89689,652158,2021-01-21,,The tart was decent given the effort and ingredients but nothing special.
88843,839669,2021-01-20,2021-01,
88843,839023,2021-01-17,,The pastry was very good and flaky but crumbly and hard to handle. The chocolate flan had a funny taste.... maybe it needed more sugar?!
78420,398099,2021-01-05,,Delicious especially with the cucumber yoghurt
193483,2277620,2020-12-31,2020-12,
195898,2326039,2020-12-27,2020-12,
190161,2205977,2020-12-20,,These were amazing! I used two teaspoons of ginger instead of cinnamon and allspice.
182075,1861999,2020-12-16,2020-12,
195740,2359224,2020-12-10,,Delicious!
182073,1855798,2020-12-09,,Baked as 12 individual muffins. Delicious!
195898,2327372,2020-12-09,,This exceeded my expectations! Delicious! I used feta instead of goats cheese.
167203,1533026,2020-12-03,,Amazing!
140796,1347032,2020-12-03,,"This was very good, better than expected. Not sure why it's 'spring' cabbage, for me cabbage is a winter staple."
195898,2326187,2020-12-01,,Delicious!
140796,1335507,2020-11-28,,Nothing memorable
111275,1211439,2020-11-15,2020-11,Delicious with extra halva.
195898,2326049,2020-11-08,2020-11,Used Mayo instead of feta and still delicious!
195898,2326040,2020-10-26,,Delicious with extra black olives.
125782,1164086,2020-10-21,,I used a 250 g pack of cannelloni (24) and there was some filling leftover which I mixed with the tomato sauce.
195740,2359765,2020-10-17,,Used egg noodles. The tofu was amazing and the noodles were nothing special.
195740,2359782,2020-10-13,,"Substituted some of the aubergines with courgettes, and the kohlrabi with sweet potato. Didn't do the salsa and chillies. Served on naans. Delicious but heavily modified."
186630,2023228,2020-10-10,2020-10,
125809,1184955,2020-09-28,2020-09,They’re ok but a bit dry. Will not make them again.
195740,2359221,2020-09-15,,"It's worth buying the book just for this recipe. I tried it with pasta, as shepherds pie, lasagna - all delicious!"
195740,2360057,2020-09-14,2020-09,
176446,1709982,2020-09-02,,"I skipped the garlic, creme fraiche and vermouth so not sure whether I can claim I’ve cooked this."
128057,1199098,2020-08-31,,The cake was delicious. I added two beaten egg whites for extra moisture and fluffiness.
192334,2180312,2020-08-27,,"This wasn't bad, but the amount of dough was way too much. I would have preferred a thinner layer of dough."
128057,1199097,2020-08-09,2020-08,
192334,2180477,2020-08-09,,Used small sweet peppers instead of the courgette flowers. It was OK but nothing memorable.
167203,1533067,2020-08-05,2020-08,
193483,2277592,2020-07-28,,"Delicious, skipped the tahini."
190161,2200411,2020-07-13,,Delicious with fresh dill instead of mint.
193483,2276736,2020-07-10,,I didn't enjoy the cucumber + tahini combo. Won't be making this again.
193483,2275587,2020-07-02,2020-07,
190161,2205980,2020-06-23,,This is spectacular!
188206,2043738,2020-06-21,,I added some roasted butternut squash and it was lovely!
176446,1707250,2020-06-17,,Tasty and easy. Next time would skip the sherry in the eggs.
176446,1709330,2020-06-17,2020-06,
78420,398114,2020-06-15,2020-06,
78420,398018,2020-06-14,,Tasty but still too hot even though I reduced the chillies and black pepper by a tenth. Next time will go even slower with the heat.
125805,1374373,2020-06-08,2020-06,
125805,1374186,2020-06-04,2018-05,
176325,1757898,2020-06-03,,Delicious!

191839,2184678,2020-05-28,2020-05,
176325,1754553,2020-05-26,,"I didn't like it at all, considered it not edible. The whole thing went to the bin unfortunately."
78420,398092,2020-05-19,,Good but nothing special
176325,1757822,2020-05-18,2020-05,
163446,1509744,2020-05-18,2000-05,

176325,1757892,2020-05-15,2020-05,Delicious!
129477,1219813,2020-05-15,,Nothing wow. The base would be better with biscuits
176325,1757800,2020-05-12,,Fine but nothing special
186192,2162056,2020-05-10,,Made them with halloumi but next should try with feta.
174412,1635114,2020-05-03,,Failure!

15348,377487,2020-05-02,,Amazing! wow wow wow!
15348,377459,2020-05-02,,Very tasty; too many potatoes - should use less.
15348,377458,2020-05-02,,Very very tasty. True about the filling - be generous!
15348,377411,2020-05-02,,This was good but the sweet potato was too sweet.
